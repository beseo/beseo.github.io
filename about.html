                            Hello! My name is <b id = 'name'>Beomsuk Seo</b>. 
                            I am a student at the <b>University of California, San Diego</b>, <br>
                            currently working towards my B.S. in Data Science at the 
                            <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/" id = "hdsi">Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute</a>.
                            <br>Currently in my 2nd year (Junior Standing), I am on track to complete my degree
                            by the <br><b>Spring of 2025</b>. As of right now, I am seeking an internship for 
                            the <b>Summer of 2023</b>. <br><br>
                            I was born in <i>Daegu, South Korea</i> (2003) and have lived in Los Angeles since 
                            moving <br>here at 3 years old. Since then, I have found my love for coding, music, and group dynamics.
                            <br>I've never liked wasting time, and still am quite picky about where I allocate my 
                            efforts. The<br> things I <i>do</i> spend my time on, however, I give my <i>absolute</i> all to,
                            leading me to be known as <br>a sort of <b>"Jack of a few trades, master of all"</b> between 
                            my colleagues. 
                            
                            <br><br>In my free time, I like to play the Cello and Piano, study Japanese, and sing.
                            All of my <br>passions have led me to develop <b>meaningful</b> relationships with others, and 
                            I hope to<br> continue forming new bonds, and grow with those around me.
